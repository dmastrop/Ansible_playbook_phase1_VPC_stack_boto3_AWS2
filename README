# Overview for project21

Project21: Use ansible playbook to create complete VPC stack on AWS2. Note using an EC2 instance with ansible, botocore, boto3 and aws cli v2, python3,pip installed. Use IAM role attached to ansible EC2 instance for authentication.


## Software version control

Create a local workspace on VSCode so that the yml playbook files can be easily edited.

Create the remote repository and push the code to the remote repository

initialize git on the project folder on the ansible-EC2-project21 folder home/ubuntu/vpc-stack-vprofile and git remote add origin to the remote git repository above.

For the vars/output_vars_IDs file, this file is created on ansible-EC2-project21 only. 
After it is created on the ansible EC2 instance do: git push origin main to remote github repo
Then do: git pull origin main on the VSCode workspace. 
This needs to be updated each time prior to running the bastion-instance.yml that sets up the bastion host on the VPC
This is required because the bastion-instance.yml imports the vars/output_vars_IDs file in order to set up the bastion host on the VPC and in the public subnet (subnet number 1 will be used)

IMPORTANT: it is important after getting VPC setup to pull the new output_vars_IDs file from the EC2 instance into VSCode to get rid of the older 
file in VSCode and update it, so that the next push from VSCode has the same latest current IDs

Use debug module throughout the playbook to help troubleshoot any syntax coding issues.





# Create output of all the IDs for the objects above so that we can use the IDs to create a bastion host

The code below is for this purpose. This is in the vpc-setup.yml ansible playbook:
- debug:
        var: "{{item}}"

      loop:
      # list all the ID's you want to store in the vars file
      # This will print out in debug
        - vpcoutvariable.vpc.id
        - pubsub1_out_variable.subnet.id
        - pubsub2_out_variable.subnet.id
        - pubsub3_out_variable.subnet.id
        - privsub1_out_variable.subnet.id
        - privsub2_out_variable.subnet.id
        - privsub3_out_variable.subnet.id
        - igw_out_variable.gateway_id
        - publicroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id
        - NATGW_out_variable.nat_gateway_id
        - privateroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id


    - set_fact:
    # set the ids above as fact variables
        vpcid: "{{vpcoutvariable.vpc.id}}"
        pubsub1id: "{{ pubsub1_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        pubsub2id: "{{ pubsub2_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        pubsub3id: "{{ pubsub3_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        privsub1id: "{{ privsub1_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        privsub2id: "{{ privsub2_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        privsub3id: "{{ privsub3_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        igwid: "{{ igw_out_variable.gateway_id }}"
        pubRTid: "{{ publicroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id }}"
        NATGWid: "{{ NATGW_out_variable.nat_gateway_id }}"
        privRTid: "{{ privateroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id }}"
        cacheable: yes
        # cacheable means that these vars are added to fact cache.
        # These permit the ids to be used during runtime execution of the playbooks.


    - name: Create variables file for vpc output IDs
      copy:
        content: "vpcid: {{vpcoutvariable.vpc.id}}\npubsub1id: {{ pubsub1_out_variable.subnet.id }}\npubsub2id: {{ pubsub2_out_variable.subnet.id }}\npubsub3id: {{ pubsub3_out_variable.subnet.id }}\nprivsub1id: {{ privsub1_out_variable.subnet.id }}\nprivsub2id: {{ privsub2_out_variable.subnet.id }}\nprivsub3id: {{ privsub3_out_variable.subnet.id }}\nigwid: {{ igw_out_variable.gateway_id }}\npubRTid: {{ publicroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id }}\nNATGWid: {{ NATGW_out_variable.nat_gateway_id }}\nprivRTid: {{ privateroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id }}\n"
        dest: vars/output_vars_IDs


Ultimately the vars/output_vars_IDs will be used for the second ansible playbook to create the bastion host.



# Create the playbook for the bastion host bastion-instance.yml

This will use the vars/output-vars_IDs from above as well as variables in bastion_setup file (ami id, etc)

Note ec2 module is deprecated. Must use the ec2_instance module.

Use this reference to construct the ec2_instance module task in the bastion-instance.yml file
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/aws/ec2_instance_module.html

For the pem rsa security key make sure to store it one directory up from the repository directory in the ansible-EC2-project21 instance

This is the ec2_instance module task
